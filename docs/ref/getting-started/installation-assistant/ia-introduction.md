# Installation Assistant Introduction

The Installation Assistant provides a simple and guided way to install and configure Wazuh on Linux systems, both x86_64/AMD64 and AARCH64/ARM64. This tool automates the installation process, reducing the complexity and time required to get Wazuh up and running.

With the Installation Assistant, you can perform AIO (All In One) installations where you download and configure all components on the same machine, or distributed installations where you can install only the specified component.

> **note** The Installation Assistant is designed to facilitate the initial installation of Wazuh. For advanced or custom configurations, additional manual configuration may be required after the initial installation.
