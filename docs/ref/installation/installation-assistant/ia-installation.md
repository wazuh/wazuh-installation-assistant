# Installation Assistant Installation

The Installation Assistant can be installed by downloading the `wazuh-install.sh` script from the Wazuh packages repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/5.0/wazuh-install.sh
```

If you want to perform an installation of a specific component, you must also download the config.yml file with:

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/5.0/config.yml
```
