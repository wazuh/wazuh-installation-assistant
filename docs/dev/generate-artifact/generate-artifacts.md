# Generate Artifacts

This section covers everything related to generating artifacts for the Installation Assistant tools.
Artifacts can be generated in 2 different ways:

- Manually ([generate-artifacts-manually.md](generate-artifacts-manually.md)): Using the `builder.sh` file, we can generate artifacts manually.
- Automatically ([generate-artifacts-workflow.md](generate-artifacts-workflow.md)): Using the GitHub Actions workflow called `Build Installation Assistant`.
