# Set up the Development Environment

## Dependencies

The Installation Assistant code is written in Bash; therefore, it does not require specialized dependencies, only basic operating system packages:

- systemd
- grep
- tar
- coreutils
- sed
- procps-ng (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora distributions only)
- procps (Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions only)
- gawk
- curl

## Set Up the Toolchain

As this is a Bash-based project, the necessary toolchain is simply a development environment with a text editor or IDE and access to a Bash terminal. We recommend using a Linux environment or WSL on Windows to facilitate development and testing.

## Set the editor/debugger

Any editor and debugger can be used; feel free to use your favorite one.
